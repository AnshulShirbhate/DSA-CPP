1. In recursion the first step to do before anything is to write the base case where the function will always terminate.

2. In recursion the best way to solve the problem is to solve the first step and let the problem solve itself by writing the
   required condition correctly.

3. Find the recurrence relation and implement it in code and the problem will be solved in no time.
